## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x LTS
- Docker 20.x+
- Azure CLI 2.x+
- Medplum CLI (latest)
- Hyperledger Fabric SDK 2.2+

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/myElixir/healthcare-marketplace.git
   cd healthcare-marketplace
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install security tools:
   ```bash
   npm install -g snyk
   npm install -g sonarqube-scanner
   ```

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Configure required environment variables:
   - `MEDPLUM_API_KEY`: Your Medplum API credentials
   - `AZURE_AD_B2C_TENANT`: Azure AD B2C tenant details
   - `HYPERLEDGER_CREDENTIALS`: Blockchain network credentials

### Development Tools

- VS Code with recommended extensions:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - SonarLint
  - FHIR Tools

### Security Tools Setup

1. Configure HIPAA compliance scanner:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:hipaa-scan
   ```

2. Setup GDPR validation tools:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:gdpr-tools
   ```

### Compliance Tools Setup

1. Install compliance validation suite:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:compliance-tools
   ```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- Implement React security patterns
- Adhere to FHIR R4 implementation standards
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable/function names reflecting PHI/PII handling

### Git Workflow

1. Create feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/ISSUE-123-feature-description
   ```

2. Regular commits following format:
   ```
   type(scope): description [#issue] [HIPAA/GDPR tags]
   ```

3. Submit PR against `develop` branch

### Branch Naming

- Feature branches: `feature/ISSUE-123-description`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/ISSUE-123-description`
- Security fixes: `security/ISSUE-123-description`
- Compliance updates: `compliance/ISSUE-123-description`

### Testing Requirements

- 100% test coverage required
- Performance tests must meet thresholds:
  - API response time: <2s
  - Error rate: <1%
  - Uptime: 99.9%

### Security Standards

#### HIPAA Technical Safeguards

- Implement access controls
- Enable encryption at rest/transit
- Maintain audit logs
- Enable automatic logoff
- Implement unique user identification

#### GDPR Requirements

- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- Storage limitation
- Accuracy maintenance
- Integrity and confidentiality

### Performance Requirements

- API Response Time: <2s
- System Uptime: 99.9%
- Error Rate: <1%
- Resource Utilization: <80%

## Security Requirements

### HIPAA Compliance

- PHI encryption (AES-256)
- Access control implementation
- Audit logging
- Data backup/recovery
- Security incident procedures

### GDPR Requirements

- Data protection by design
- Data protection by default
- Data subject rights implementation
- Breach notification procedures
- Data processing documentation

### Security Review Process

1. Automated Security Scans:
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
   - SCA (Software Composition Analysis)

2. Manual Security Review:
   - Code review by security team
   - Architecture review
   - Threat modeling

### PHI/PII Handling

- Data encryption requirements
- Access control implementation
- Audit logging requirements
- Data retention policies
- Secure deletion procedures

### Incident Response

1. Detection and Analysis
2. Containment
3. Eradication
4. Recovery
5. Post-Incident Analysis

### Vulnerability Management

- Regular security assessments
- Vulnerability scanning
- Patch management
- Risk assessment
- Security monitoring

## Pull Request Process

1. Complete security checklist
2. Pass compliance validation
3. Meet performance requirements
4. Obtain required approvals:
   - Security team review
   - Compliance team review
   - Technical lead review
